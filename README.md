# Customer-Churn-Telecom

# Project Name
This project is a part of the Customer-Churn-Telecom in which I am Predicting will customer get churn from Telecom Industry. 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to let Telecom Industry know which customers are loyal and which are customers will likely get churn. The dataset consists of customer details such as age, income, monthly payment, debt ratio by analysing these variables need to predict the target variable churn.

## Project Description
This is the first Data Science Project for me where I did EDA on the dependent variables like droped the duplicate variables, reset index, visualize boxplot, find the missing values on a dataset consisting of almost 150k entries with 8 columns. 
   


## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- predictive modeling



## Getting Started
*Resampled the dataset so as to make the sample size of churn equal and to obtain better accuracy. 
*Normalised the resampled data by min-max scaler or standerd scaler to otain consistancy throughout the data.
*Checked if the dependent variables are correlated with the target variable and split the data to train and test.
*Applied RandomForest Classifier as the target variable was categorical and evaluated the matrices with confusion matrics.
*Performed Cross-validation on the machine learning model and predicted an accuracy of 99.16%.
